# Hanging Penguins By Ishraq Mahid and Nathan Kuo Period 2/3

## About
Our project idea was inspired by the penguin problem done in class. We hoped to make a simulation where users can hang toy penguins from bars to play around with balancing them. In addition, we allow the user to change the masses of individual penguins and the length of the beams. Through this, variables can be adjusted to observe different results and the degree to which changes in tilt occurs. This project is made in Processing. The project will has a static “frozen” state and an animated state. During the static state, the user can drag and drop bars and penguins into the environment. The bars have attachment segments to allow the user the ability to control the length of beams, rather than relying on tiny pixels. Once the user has finished setting everything up, then they can press a play button to start an animated result to see whether or not the system is balanced. There is also a reset button to quickly clear everything and start anew.
